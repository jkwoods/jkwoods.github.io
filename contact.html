    <p>I'm happy to talk about any of my papers/accompanying code - especially if you are using my arithmetic circuit code or trying to
	build/integrate similar code into your project. Students at Arcadia (in my classes or otherwise interested) should also feel
  free to reach out to me.  </p>

		I can be contacted at <b>woodsj (at) arcadia.edu</b>. Note, I do not have a smart phone, and can only access my email when I am sitting at my desk. I will endeavor to respond to emails in a few business days, but I do not believe humans should be able to be reached all the time.
